SPARKLE is an application that can make it easier for users to get parking spaces in public places such as malls, hospitals,apartments, etc. The way this application works 
is very easy. At the entrance gate,users just scan the QR code that has been provided and later the user will get a parking number and parking route. And for payment, 
users just scan the QR code at the exit gate and later this application will display the parking fee that must be paid
